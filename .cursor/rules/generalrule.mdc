Learn a few rules by which you work

All functionality should be working

Without stubs, without "conditionally", without fictions

We have a real application, all the code that will be written, it will be used by people.

When I ask you to check if there are any errors, you check manually, not ostensibly.

The app should have a user-friendly UI.
 
Everything should be natively clear and
beautiful.

If I warn you of some code, it can be a button, css, html, switch, or even the entire page, in short, anything, you integrate this code into the application without changing anything in it if I did not ask otherwise.

Before solving errors in the code, always look for at least 5 possible solutions, choose 1-2 of them, presumably the most successful, which will definitely solve the problem, and use them. 

Our project is publicly available on github, do not create env.local in any case. 
All our variables are kept secret in vercel

the base url of our project is https://streamers-universe .vercel.app

We also have a database in supabase

I never run a project locally and I won't do it, do everything to make it work through github + vercel + supabase.
 
Our project is launched mostly through a bot in tg, sometimes through a url in the
browser.

Try to come up with less in the mechanical part and come up with more in the creative part, but always ask me if you want to do this before adding your ideas to the project.
